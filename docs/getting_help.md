# Getting help

Something not working as expected?

TL;DR:

Help us help you by providing:

* Which Bluepad32 platform you are using, and version.
* Which ESP32 module you are using. Add a link if possible
* Which controller you are using, including the controller firmware version. Add a link if possible.
* Which sketch you are using.
* Which Operating System you are using
* Debug log
* Post question on our [Discord server][discord_server]
* File bugs in our [Github Issue Tracker][github_issue_tracker]

[discord_server]: https://discord.gg/r5aMn6Cw5q

[github_issue_tracker]: https://github.com/ricardoquesada/bluepad32/issues

## Platforms

Bluepad32 supports different platforms, like:

* Arduino IDE for ESP32 modules
* Arduino IDE for NINA coprocessors, like the Arduino Nano RP2040 Connect
* Arduino + ESP-IDF
* CircuitPython for AirLift coprocessors
* ESP-IDF
* Pico SDK
* Unijoysticle
* MightyMiggy

So, provide the platform you are using, and the version. And also which Bluepad32 version!

E.g: I'm using Arduino IDE v2.0.9 with Bluepad32 v3.7.3

## DevKit Module

Not all devkits are created equal.

Which devkkit are you using? Provide a link to the device.

E.g: I'm using Sparkfun Thing Plus - ESP32 WROOM: <https://www.sparkfun.com/products/17381>

## Controllers

Not all controllers behave the same way... some are reliable... some not.

The officially supported controllers are enumerated here:

* [Supported gamepads][supported_gamepads]
* [Supported mice][supported_mice]
* [Supported keyboards][supported_keyboards]

Please provide: brand, model, firmware and link to the device (if applicable).
Also mention whether it is genuine or a knock-off.

E.g.: I'm using a genuine Nintendo Switch JoyCon using FW 3.72.

If you are using a controller not listed there, YOU ARE ON YOUR OWN!

But if you really want us to support a gamepad that is not listed there, contact us (Send us a Private Message in
Discord channel). The way it works is:

* You send us a link to the gamepad that is not supported, like the Amazon link.
* You send us via PayPal the cost of the gamepad + shipping.
* We purchase it, and we will do our best to support it. But we don't guarantee anything... so many things can go
  wrong... especially with low-cost clones where many features are not implemented.

## Sketch

Share your sketch.

But share with us the smallest sketch that reproduces the bug. Remove all the things that are not related to Bluepad32.

Copy & paste your sketch in services like: <http://gist.github.com>

DO NOT COPY your sketch on Discord. It is difficult to read it there.

E.g.: The sketch that I'm using is in this URL (add a link).

## Operating System

Are you using Windows, macOS, Linux? Which version?

E.g.: I'm using macOS 12.6.7

## Debug log

Copy & paste the output from the serial console, and share it with us.

Use services like: <http://gist.github.com>

Attaching a screenshot might be useful, but the screenshot is not a replacement of the Debug Log.

E.g.: The console output can be found on this link (add link).
